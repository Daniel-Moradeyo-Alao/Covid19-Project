# Covid_19 Project
Thoroughly explored, cleaned, analyzed and visualized updated Covid-19 data as follows:
The Covid-19 data was cleaned as follows: firstly, checked through the data for possible null values in different columns. additonally, filled rows with null under continent column with "Others" since there are figures allocated to total_cases, total_deaths, etc in the data.
No duplicated values in the data.
Filtered out needless items from both location and continent columns.
Date was converted from object datatype to datetime datatype.
Formated date column to day_month_year.
Analysis was done to identify palpable cases of Covid-19 using different category such as continent, country,  etc.
The data was visualized through graphical representation such as seaborn's countplot and barplot, and flourish studio visualisation.
